#Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
The main function in base R for PCA is called 'prcomp()'. Here we will use PCA to examine the funny food that folks eat in the uk and N. Ireland.

Importing the csv fiel first


```{r}
x <- read.csv("UK_foods.csv", row.names =1)
View(x)
x
```
```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=T, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))

pairs(x, col=rainbow(10), pch=16)

pca<-prcomp(t(x))
summary(pca)

plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], xlab="PC1", ylab="PC2", xlim=c(-270,500))
text(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], colnames(x), col=c("black","red","blue","darkgreen"))

```


```
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
